Add some common financial/accounting reports and some wizards to quickly compute them:
    * Account chart list
    * Invoice list
    * Account move (journal ledger)
    * Account move line
    * Account balance compared period-fiscal year
    * Cumulative general ledger

They can be found in the "Financial Management/Legal Statements/Generic Reports" menu or in the tree/form views of accounts, journals, invoices, account entries and account move lines.

Some reports are based on previous work by Pexego and others on the *c2c_finance_report* module for TinyERP 4.2 by Camptocamp SA.
