    "description": """  This module offer a growing collection of objects to create simple and advanced reports in a new way of doing.
                   You can create powerful reports with a few lines of python code and nothing else. (no sxw, rml or xml)
                   This module follow multiple goals: 
                     - To accelerate report creation by creating reusable pieces of code (one line of code to create standard header and footer)
                     - To accelerate report generation (processing) by getting ride of uncecessary parsing and transformations (direct python to pdf generation) 
                     - To improve reporting capabilities by getting ride of uncomplete parsers and limited middle technologies 
                     - To make reports designs more uniform 
                   
                   For exemples of use, have a look at c2c_planning_management. Our first module based on this tool.
