    'name': 'Bank Deposit Ticket',
    'description': '''
This module supports the functionality to prepare and record Bank Deposit Tickets, often found in check centric markets like the US. It allows users to select various customer payments and receipts and bundle them into a Deposit Ticket. This would be used to support the following activities: Depositing multiple Checks into your bank account under one deposit ticket, and Deposit Checks and Cash into your bank account from multiple customer receipts or payments. This module can be used for any “bank transaction” centric process including: Paypal, Bank Accounts, and even credit cards – which tend to deposit funds by bundled transactions versus individual checks. By combining payments and receipts into deposit tickets, and using this module to manage the general ledger entries, it will streamline the bank account statement reconciliation process (defined as: comparing your bank account transactions versus the recorded transactions in OpenERP for audit and financial control purposes).

This module also tracks who prepared the Deposit Ticket, and the user who verified the deposit ticket. In addition to the following: Method of Deposit (e.g. ATM, Night Drop, Teller, Remote Deposit Capture, Online Deposit Capture); Bank Tracking number (e.g. TLR#3 BC#47331 REF#94849303938); Date of Deposit, Deposit Bag #,  etc.

We recommend users add to their GL Chart of Accounts a new Other Current Account named Undeposited Funds, as well as a new journal to post payments to with the Undeposited Funds on the debit side of the transaction.

Future enhancements – will also include the ability to track deposits NOT using the Undeposited Funds GL account.

Why is this module needed? OpenERP by default is designed for more electronic transaction management – driven by its heritage in Europe when EFT (electronic) transactions are more readily used – versus Check centric transactions. In electronic transaction management – bundled deposits don’t typically occur as payment transactions typically are displayed individual on statements.

This module is seen as a prerequisite to support efficient Bank Account Statement Reconciliation found in the US and other countries.
