Product Cost field Report
=========================

This module override the reporting view of OpenERP to replace the standard_price field used
by the new cost_price one. This way all reporting of OpenERP will now take this field into 
account and display the correct result.

We're talking here about the reporting found under : Reporting -> Warehouse
